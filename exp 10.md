# Aim: To perform Content Creation (Reports, Articles, Case Studies, etc.) Using Prompt Patterns

# Algorithm: To demonstrate how various prompting techniques (query decomposition, decision-making, semantic filtering, etc.) can be employed to create content such as reports, articles, case studies, or creative works like comic books, using ChatGPT or similar models. The objective is to highlight how different prompt structures affect the content's quality, coherence, and structure.


# Result :  The corresponding prompt executed successfully.

Algorithm / Procedure Step 1: Problem Definition

Identify the type of content to be generated - report, article, or case study. Define the objective, audience, and tone of the final content.

Step 2: Apply Prompt Patterns

Use structured prompt patterns to guide Al models in generating well-organized and contextually accurate content. Common patterns include:

Persona Pattern - Defines the Al's role (e.g., journalist, researcher, or analyst).

Chain of Thought Pattern - Guides logical reasoning and structured content flow.

Few-Shot Prompting Pattern - Provides examples to help Al mimic desired style or

structure.

Query Decomposition Pattern - Breaks complex content creation tasks into smaller questions.

Decision-Making Pattern - Helps Al choose the best approach among alternatives.

Semantic Filtering Pattern - Ensures outputs stay relevant and on-topic.

Step 3: Content Generation Process

Decompose the Query: Break down the main request (e.g., "Write a case study education") into smaller parts:

Introduction and background

Key issues or challenges
Solutions or Al applications

Results and future scope

Refine Through Decision-Making Prompts: Example: "Choose whether this report should focus on technical or social aspects of Al in education, and explain why."

Apply Semantic Filtering: Ensure that irrelevant or off-topic information is removed by specifying clear inclusion criteria (e.g., "Focus only on real-world applications post-2020").

Iterate and Refine: Adjust the prompt to enhance creativity, factual depth, or stylistic alignment.

Generate and Evaluate: Compare outputs created using different prompting styles for coherence, fluency, and informativeness.

Example: Case Study Generation Using Prompt Patterns Prompt 1 (Query Decomposition + Persona Pattern):

"Act as a data scientist. Write a case study on how Al was implemented in a hospital to improve patient care. Break the report into sections: introduction, problem statement, implementation, results, and conclusion."

Prompt 2 (Decision-Making + Semantic Filtering):

"From your generated report, remove any marketing language and focus only on measurable results and patient outcomes. Decide which metrics best show improvement and justify the choice."

Result:

The second prompt yields a more focused, evidence-based, and professionally structured case study compared to the first, demonstrating how prompt patterns influence quality and tone.

Applications

Academic report and research paper writing

Corporate documentation and business reports

Blog or article creation with style consistency

Case study generation and summarization

Creative storytelling, comic script writing, and media scripting
Advantages

Produces coherent and structured content

Improves factual accuracy through semantic control

Enhances tone and style alignment

Reduces redundancy and off-topic details

Increases control over creativity and focus

Conclusion

This experiment highlights that prompt pattern engineering plays a crucial role in Al-based content generation. By strategically using techniques like query decomposition, decision- making, and semantic filtering, users can create more accurate, readable, and goal- oriented outputs. Prompt refinement and iteration ensure that content generated by LLMs aligns with the user's intent, making Al a powerful assistant for professional and creative writing.
